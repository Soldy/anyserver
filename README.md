## Any Server

This is a lightweight, simple, dependency-free mockup RESTful API server. It is a tool that can be used right out of the box. 

Please note that this tool is intended for local use only. It has not undergone any third-party security audits, so it should not be used in a live environment.

This tool is designed to assist developers in creating a RESTful frontend when the backend may not be available for testing or use.
