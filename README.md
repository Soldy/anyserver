## AnyServer

This is a lightweight, simple, and dependency-free mockup RESTful API server that can be used right out of the box.
It is designed to assist developers in creating a RESTful frontend when the backend may not be available for testing or use.
One of the standout features of this server is its easy integration with mitmproxy, although this functionality will not be documented at this time. 
Any server is also useful for storing data collection gathered from various sources and can convert it into AXP. Can replicate certain functionalities without human intervention.


### Please remember
This tool is intended for local use only. It has not undergone third-party security audits and should not be used in a live environment.


### Usage

The server is available in two versions: a single-file version (server.py) and the complete source code in the "include" directory. It is recommended to use the single-file version with command line options.

```
python3 server.py --port 8999 --host localhost

```
